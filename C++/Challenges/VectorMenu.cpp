/*
 * This challenge is about using a collection (list) of integers and allowing the user
 * to select options from a menu to perform operations on the list.
 * 
 * Your program should display menu options to the user as follows:
 * 
 * P - Print numbers
 * A - Add a number
 * M - Display the mean of the numbers
 * S - Display the smallest number
 * L - Display the largest number
 * Q - Quit
 * 
 * Enter your choice:
 * 
 * The program should only accept valid choices from the user, both upper and lowercase selections should be allowed.
 * If an illegal choice is made, you should display "Unknown selection, please try again" and the menu options should
 * be displayed again.
 * 
 * If the user enters 'P' or 'p', you should display all of the elements (ints) in the list.
 * If the list is empty you should display "[] - the list is empty."
 * If the list is not empty then all the list elements should be displayed inside square brackets separated
 * by a space.
 * For example, [1 2 3 4 5]
 * 
 * If the user enters 'A' or 'a' then you should prompt the user for an integer to add to the list
 * which you will add and then display that it was added. For example, if the user enters 5, you
 * should display "5 added"
 * Diplicate list entries are OK.
 * 
 * If the user enters 'M' or 'm' you should calculate the mean or average of the elements in the list and display it.
 * If the list is empty you should display, "Unable to calculate the mean - no data"
 * 
 * If the user enters 'S' or 's' you should display the smallest element in the list.
 * For example, if the list contains [2 4 5 1], you should display "The smallest number is 1"
 * If the list is empty you should display "Unable to determine the smallest number - list is empty"
 * 
 * If the user enters 'L' or 'l' you should display the largest element in the list
 * For example, if the list contains [2 4 5 1] you should display "The largest number is 5"
 * If the list is empty you should display "Unable to determine the largest number - list is empty"
 * 
 * If the user enters 'Q' or 'q' then you should display "Goodbye" and the program should terminate.
 * 
 * Additional functionality if you wish to extend this program:
 * 
 * - search for a number in the list and if found then display the number of times it occurs in the list
 * - clearing out the list (make it empty again) (Hint: the vector class has a .clear() method)
 * - don't allow duplicate entries
 * - come up with your own ideas!
